#Result
#The above code may fail as 
# StopIteration issue, Hugging Face’s InferenceClient can’t find a provider for the 
# model picked (google/flan-t5-base). 
# In plain terms → the model is on the Hub, but it isn’t served by the 
# nference API (no “warm” serverless endpoint).

# That’s why client.text_generation fails.

#Option 2
#Use a supported model

#The above code may fail as ValueError: Model HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-alpha is not supported for 
#task text-generation and provider featherless-ai. Supported task: conversational.

#Zephyr-7B is only exposed through Hugging Face Inference API under the conversational task (chat-like input/output), not text-generation.
#But HuggingFaceEndpoint defaults to the text-generation task.
